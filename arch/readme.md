- The smart meters are installed at each household and connected to the supplier through AMI.
- Smart meters make it possible to provide near real-time price incentives to customers which could potentially reduce the need for expensive peak capacity and energy. The successful adoption of smart metering and pricing could offer many benefits, including: reduction in wholesales prices, enhanced reliability, and environmental improvement.
