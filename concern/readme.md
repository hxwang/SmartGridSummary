## Concern

### 1. Electric Vehicles

#### Why become popular
- An emphasis on green technogloies and the price of gasoline is causing the number of electric vehicles to increase rapidly [[Zhou-2014]](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1402/1402.2489.pdf). 

#### Challenges
- To allow the user of electric vehicles to increase as rapidly as possible, it is necessary to find techniques to manage electric vehicle charging so that their oweners are not inconvenienced[[Zhou-2014]](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1402/1402.2489.pdf). . 


### Security
- Smart Meter
  - **Data Transmission**: In smart grid systems, high-frequency measurement data (e.g., register readings and time interval consumption data), power quality data (e.g., voltage or current phase angle) and event data (e.g., outage alert) are collected from millions of smart meters and sent to the meter data repository at utilities. These data are expected to play a key role in supporting intelligent management applications (e.g., loading forecasting, demand management, outage management, energy theft detection, etc.) and improving smart grid stability and energy efficiency. 
  - **Security Issue**: However, when the power grid evolves to become "smart", new security challenges have emerged. The security concern comes from the enlarged attack surface, for instance, smart meters are placed in physically insecure locations that are easily accessible to the adversaries, and thus are subject to attacks from physically tempering with meter reading (e.g., meter invasion) to manipulating measurement data in communication channel between meter processor and the embeded sensor. Moreover, the upgraded connectivity makes smart meters susceptible to cyber attacks in which adversaries may compromise smart meters or eavesdrop the communication.
