## [Smart Meter Privacy in the Presence of an Alternative Energy Source](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654823)


### Summary
- In this paper, the authors study the privacy of SM system in the presence of alternative energy source.

### Weakness
- their simulation have only 0, 1 binary input which is not realistic.
- they didn't consider the real senario of how many energy can the alternative energy source can provide, but only forumate the average case.


### TDOO
- the information theory parts in this paper is interesting
