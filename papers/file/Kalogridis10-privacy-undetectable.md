## [Privacy for smart meters: Towards Undetable Appliance Load Signature](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5622047)


### Summary

### Definition
- Privacy
  - Privacy is defined using **undetectability**, i.e., privacy is protected when, given a home load signature, we cannot sufficiiently distinguish whether an appliance load event exists or not.
  - They consider nay change (or no change) of appliance state, is "private" information, hence they wish to measure the degree of which the changes are detectable.

### Techniques
- Relative Entropy
  - when the power usage is the same with the output load, then the relative entropy is 0. 
  - The objective is to maximize entropy, thus to introduce more uncertainty.
  
### Algorithm
- **Best Effort (BE)** scheme
