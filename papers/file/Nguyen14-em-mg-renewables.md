## [Optimal Energy Management for Building Microgrid with Constrainted Renewable Energy Utilization](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007635)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors study energy management in microgrid with multiple energy sources.

### TODO
- I can see that they model the problem under energy constriant, battery constraint. However, I am not really aware what solutions they use to solve the formulated problem.
