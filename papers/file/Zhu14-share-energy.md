## [Sharing Renewable Energy in Smart Microgrids](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604016)

### Summary
In this paper, the author proposed a centralized mechanism to share renewable energy in micro-grid. 

### Weakness
- They use simple logic and prefer to assign energy to the users with higher energy shortage.
- Their mechanism does not allow simultaneously energy sharing.
- Their mechanism require additional architecture.
