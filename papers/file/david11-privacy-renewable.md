## [Smart Metering Privacy Using a Rechargable Battery: Minimizing The Rate of Information Leakage](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5946886)


### Summary
In this paper, the authors model the information leakage with recharagble battery. They model the systen as a finite state model and use **trellis algorithm** to estimate the mutual information rate between the battery's input and output loads.

### TODO
- Look into how they model the mutual information
