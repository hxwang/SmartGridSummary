## [Preserving User Privacy in the Smart Grid by Hiding Appliance Load Characteristics](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-03584-0_6)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed a load hiding algorithm by allowing the load to be around a constant value rather than being a constant value. 
- This changes allowed them to better utilization the battery. 
- The number of changes reduces in their proposed algorithm. However, the mutual information is higher than the Best Effor (BE) algorithm.

### Main Idea
- A tiny step change will be seen as noise and will be filter out by NILM. 

### Comment
- I feel this mechanism is very similar to [[Stepping Framework]](./yang14-privacy-minimize-disclosure.md)
