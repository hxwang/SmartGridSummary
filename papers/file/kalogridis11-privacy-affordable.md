## [Affordable Privacy for Home Smart Meters](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5951954)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed a water filling algorithm to minimize privacy leakage in smart grid.

### Algorithm
- Battery water filling algorithm
  - try to keep the same output (energy usage seen by grid) by charging/discharging the battery
    - the idea/algorithm is quite simple

### TODO
- the entropy definition of privacy is interesting
