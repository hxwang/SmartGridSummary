## [Demand-Side Management in a Smart Micro-Grid: A distributed approach based on bayesian game theory](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7007722)

### Summary
- Each consumer is endowed with *statistical information* about his and their future overall consumptions, so that he can select his actions on the basis of an expected payoff (i.e., a Bayesian approach is adopted).
  - This approach allows each prosumer to act in an autonomous fashion and to protect his privacy.
