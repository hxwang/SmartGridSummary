## [Smart Meter Privacy: A Utility-Privacy Framework](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6102315)


### Summary
- The author brings the most current treatments of the privacy-utility tradeoff into a single model.
  


### Contribution
- abstract the privacy and utility requirement of smart meter data
- tradeoff privacy and utility 
  - e.g., for a stationary Gaussian Markov model of the electricity load, it is shown that the optimal utility-and-porivacy preserving solution requires filtering out frequency components that are low in power.
