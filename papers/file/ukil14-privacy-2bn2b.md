### Summary
In this paper, the authors test the sensitivity detection and analysis outcome using real smart meter data. 

### Results
- Their scheme has higher **Mahalanobis (ML) distance**
  - depicting more detection ability
- Their scheme has larger **Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence**
  - Sanov's theorem from large deviation theory shos more KL divergence means more detection capability
