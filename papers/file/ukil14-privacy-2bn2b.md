## [IOT: To Be Private or Not To Be Private](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849186)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors test the sensitivity detection and analysis outcome using real smart meter data. The proposed a new metrics for privacy leakage and show their metrics can better detect the information leakage.
- However, it is not clear how the mtrics related to information leakage.
- Besides, their metrics is not a single expression, it includes some statistic test. This make it difficult to do the optimization.

### Results
- Their scheme has higher **Mahalanobis (ML) distance**
  - depicting more detection ability
- Their scheme has larger **Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence**
  - Sanov's theorem from large deviation theory shos more KL divergence means more detection capability
