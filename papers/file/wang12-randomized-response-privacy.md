## [Randomized Response Model for Privacy Preseving Smart Metering](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6203629)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a novel protocol, which allows individual meters to report the true electricity consumption reading with a pre-determined probability.
- Load serving entities (LSE) can reconstruct the total electricity consumption of a region or a district through inference algorithm, but their ability of identifying individual users' energy consumption pattern is significantly reduced.
