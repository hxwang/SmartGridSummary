### Summary


### Algorithm-Stepping Framework (SF)
- Objective: maximize the difference between the demand load and external load
- **Lazy-Stepping**
  - try to maintain the external load unchanged as long as possible
- **Lazy-Charging**
  - try to keep charging the battery until the battery is full and then keep discharging the battery until it is empty
- **Random-Charging**
  - randomly choose whether to charge or discharge the battery
  
### TODO
- check how they compare the algorithms
