## [Achieving Differential Privacy of Data Disclosure in the Smart Grid](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847974)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors design mechanism to achieve differnt privacy in protecting data disclosure in the smart grid. Differnt from previous works which generates noise inorder to minimize entropy, their objective is to guarantee differential privacy.

### Definition
- Differential Privacy
  - Access to a statistical database should not enable one to learn anything about an individual that could not be learned without access.

### TODO
- Since my current focus in not in differential privacy, I skip their proof and algorithm.
- Their analysis of the three classical approach, BE, NILL, SF may be helpful.
