## [iDES: Incentive-Driven distributed energy sharing in sustainble microgrids](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~yugu/paper/iDES%20Incentive-Driven%20Distributed%20Energy%20Sharing%20in%20Sustainable%20Microgrids.pdf)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a distributed mechanism for homes to trade renewable energy.

### Weakness
- The buyers choose the chpeast sellers regardless of the prices set by the sellers. Thus this is unfair to the buyers, they do not have to buy if the price is higher than the grid electricity prices.
- Does not enable simultaneously trading.
- Need extra infrastructure.
