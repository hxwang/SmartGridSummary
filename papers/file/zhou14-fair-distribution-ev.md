## [The Fair Distribution of Power to Electric Vehicles: An Alternative to Pricing](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1402/1402.2489.pdf)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate how to charge EVs as fair as possible when the peak energy is not able to simultaneously satisfy all energy demand.
