## Battery-based Load Hiding

### Intro
- One effective ay to deal with the privacy leakage from the smart meters is Battery-based Load Hiding (BLH). The main idea of BLH is to install a battery for each household and use the energy provided (discharge of the battery) and energy consumed (charge of the battery) by the battery to perturb the real energy consumed by the household appliances. By doing so, the real energy consumption of the appliances is hidden in the energy consumption reported by the smart meter. [[Zhao-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847974)

### Drawback
- The main challenge faced by the BLH schemes come from the constraints on the capacity and the maximum charging/discharging rate of the battery. [[Zhao-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847974)
- The evaluation is based on entropy theory in general. It is not clear how it relates to practise. [[Zhao-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847974)
- They didn't address the privacy requirements of different appliances. [[Zhao-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847974)
