## Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)


### Objective
- NILM can be used to extract appliance profiles from load profiles. It is considered "non-instrusive" because it does this at the electric meter without instrumenting individual appliances. 

### How it works
- Appliace Profile
  - An appliance profile consists of the types of appliances and the times during which each is operational during the day.
- NILM approach
  - Load profiling techniques classify devices by the changes in steady state load caused by their being turned "ON" and "OFF".
  - The approach is to decomposed load profile into a composite of invidual appliances features, i,e,m representative pairs of ON?OFF events.
