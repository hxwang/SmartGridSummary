## Other solutions to protect privacy

### Encrypt/Aggregation
- Rely on anonymization/escrow or aggregation techniques so that client's information can be aggregated and encrypted. Mentioned in [[Dimitriou-13]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2480488)
- **Drawback**
  - This merely transfers doubts about trustworthiness from one party to another
  
### Modifying of metered data
- **Drawback**
  - This approach requires modification of the metering infrastructure, which may not be logistically and economically viable, with millions of smart meters already isntalled. 
  - Besides, the modification of usage data could result in inaccurate billing and grid controls, thereby undermine grid management. Mentioned in [[Yang15]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6876215&tag=1)
