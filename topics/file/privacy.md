## Privacy Define and Measurement

### Entropy
- [[Arijit-2014]](../../papers/file/ukil14-privacy-2bn2b.md)
  - S: sensor data set
  - &lambda; : non-sensitive part
  - v: sensitive part
    - S = &lambda; &cup; v
  - The privacy measure is defined as the amount of difficulty to infer v when only &lambda; is presented or how much probability of finding v
