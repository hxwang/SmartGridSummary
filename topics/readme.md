### Electric Vehicles
- Manage electric vehicle charging
  - Reduce energy cost by shift power consumption from peak hours by charging less for power during on-peak hours[[Rotering-2011]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5629391&tag=1), [[Verzijlvergh-2012]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6204213).

### Worload shifting
- Schedule shiftable appliances in a way that they are activated in off-peak hours, so that the *peak-to-average  (PAR)* ratio in load demand is mitigated and the total energy cost to the utility company is reduced. [[Sola-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7007722)


### Renewable Energy Aggregation
- Aggregation [[Harirchi-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7007714)
  - Renewable energy aggregation has been introduced as a solution to reduce the uncertainty of this type of sources.
